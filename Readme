SYNOPSIS In any developing country, democracy plays an important role where a leader of a country is elected by the citizen. One of the main issues in the conventional voting system is that it consumes lots of manpower as well as resources and the preparation has to be started many days before the commencement of the election. During this preparation, some people may involve in illegal arrangements with each other or try to replace their henchmen in this process to win the election. It is a confidential process; so it must be transparent. Meddle- proof, Usable, Authenticated, Accurate, Verifiability and Mobility. There are some draw- backs to conventional voting systems such as damage to machines, chances of violence, dummy voting and proper monitoring. A manual voting system has been followed in many parts of our country so people could not cast their vote as it is placed remote. As there is region-wise distribution, voters need to reach the place of voting. To overcome these problems, a new confidential E-Voting system is introduced which provides security to the election system by detecting and recognising the voter’s face who is going to cast his/her vote. In this system, the voter’s face is detected, captured and stored in the database then match the captured image with the image already stored in database to recognize the person. If a match occurs then the person is allowed to cast their vote. Once the vote is casted, the same person will not be permitted to vote again. This provides security against duplicate voting and fraudulence and make the system more efficient and user friendly.

ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM 1
1. INTRODUCTION
In this project, a new authentication technique in the online voting system using facial
recognition of the voter is used. In India, currently, there are two types of voting
systems in practice. They are secret Ballet paper and Electronic Voting Machines
(EVM), but both processes have some limitations or demerits. In India online voting
has not been yet implemented. The current voting system is not safe and secure too.
The voters need to go to distributed places like polling booths and stand in a long queue
to cast their vote, because of these reasons most people miss their chance of voting.
The voter who is not eligible can also cast their vote by fake means which may lead to
many problems. That's why in this project we have to propose a system or way for
voting which is very effective or useful in voting. In our approach, we have two levels
of security in the voting process.
The first level is the verification of a unique id number (UID), and the second level is
face recognition or face matching. The security level of our system is greatly improved
by the new application method for each voter.
The user authentication process of the system is improved by adding face recognition
in an application which will identify whether the particular user has authenticated user
or not. The online voting system offers the highest levels of transparency, control,
security and efficiency of election processes. Online voting provides voters a
comfortable and secure voting experience. Paper-based voting are both cost-intensive
and burdensome for the environment. One of the benefits of online voting is that they
don’t require many resources. Online voting allows you to access results shortly after
the election. As face identity is unique among voters, face recognition is one of the
best tool to avoid bogus voting.
In India we used two types of voting process. Traditionally we used ballot papers to
vote and the votes are counted manually, which consume excess of time. Then ballot
papers are replaced by electronic voting machine as it consumes large time to count
the votes and due to the error involved in the manual counting process.
The electronic voting machine gives quick publication of result which is accurate. In
existing system, there are so many chances to misuse the votes as it does not have
proper identification system In our technique, iris and Finger print are used.
Fingerprint is unique for every single person, so that we can avoid bogus voting. But
for old person and cancer patients the fingerprint is not clearly visible so we introduced
the technique called iris scanning, so that they can cast their votes.

The voter can log in using a password and id. No one can log in without knowing the
password and id. Not only that there is one more security added to it which is face
recognition. Even if a person knows another person’s password and id, he can proceed
only if the machine Recognizes the face. so this is a secure mode. Other features
include vote counting and final result. The voter can log in, the candidate can register
through this system and the total number of votes each candidate got can also be
calculated.

2.PROBLEM SELECTION
The online voting system offers the highest levels of transparency, control, security
and efficiency of election processes. Online voting provides voters with a comfortable
and secure voting experience. Paper-based voting is both cost-intensive and
burdensome for the environment. One of the benefits of online voting is that they don’t
require many resources. Online voting allows you to access results shortly after the
election. As face identity is unique among voters, face recognition is one of the best
tools to avoid bogus voting.
The entire system operates manually i.e, a machine and paper-based voting system,
which requires a lot of manpower and a lot of resources. Bogus voting, lengthy process,
time taken. The time and place of voting are predefined. Maintaining discipline and
security requires a lot of manpower.
The majority of the conventional voting techniques have been employed over the years
in elections. Each of these techniques had attendant shortcomings. The existing
conventional voting systems have been subjected to gross abuse and irregularities.
Electronic voting which is emerging as an alternative to these conventional voting
systems, though highly promising is not free of flaws; remote internet voting systems
still suffer from many security problems which rely on the clients, the servers, and the
network connections. Denial-of-service attacks and viruses still belong among the
most challenging security issues. In this project,
we discuss the security issues associated with remote internet voting. In particular, we
examine the feasibility of running national elections over the Internet. The focus of
this project is on the limitations of the currently deployed infrastructure in terms of the
security of the hosts and the Internet itself. We conclude that without appropriate
security measuresinternet-baseded elections can be a challenge

3.1GANTT CHART
Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule, named after its
inventor, Henry Gantt (1861–1919), who designed a chart around the years 1910–
1915. Modern Gantt charts also show the dependency relationships between activities
and current schedule status. This chart lists the tasks to be performed on the vertical
axis, and time intervals on the horizontal axis. The 2the start and finish dates of the
terminal elements and summary elements of a project. Terminal elements and
summary elements constitute the work breakdown structure of the project. Modern
Gantt charts also show the dependency (i.e., precedence network) relationships
between activities.

4.SYSTEM STUDY
4.1 EXISTING SYSTEM
In the present system, there are no such application-level system provisions in the
country to carry out the voting and procedure as a whole. Also in the present status,
there is no such application in use for an automated system for voting according to the
voting structure existing in the country. All the step-by-step procedures are carried out
by the authorized authorities according to the jobs assigned by the ECI. The fact is all
the procedures are carried out manually, starting from the registration process to result
in publishing.
The current voting system is the conventional voting system built on a ballot machine
where the votisare allowed to cast their vote by pressing the button along with the
symbol on the voting machine. So there arise some security risks that the person may
cast their votes more than one time, fraud, breakage of the system, and theft may
happen. In this conventional systemthe , ballot begins before a week and the voters go
to the polling booth to cast their votes.
To provide security huge manpower is required to avoid malpractices, to avoid such
security issues and malpractices a new E-voting system has been introduced using
biometric technology which uses face detection and recognition to cast their vote their
place without moving to the polling booth they can cast their votes through online. By
using the face as their identity they avoid the security issues of a conventional system.
The government does this process manually wastes a lot of time and money. Thus, the
present system proves itself to be an inefficient one. The existing system is not web￾based. The user or person must want to go to the polling station for casting their votes
Major Drawbacks of the system
The main drawbacks of the existing system are
•The entire system operates manually i.e., a machine and paper-based voting system,
which requires a lot of manpower and a lot of resources.
•Bogus voting is, a lengthy process, and time is taken.
•The time and place of voting are predefined.
•Maintaining discipline and security requires a lot of manpower.
4.2 PROPOSED SYSTEM
The basic idea of this project is to create a system to conduct online voting through an
electronic voting machine. It is a project on the combination of java and python. The
benefit of this method is to avoid fraudulent voting and it is a secure one also. The
voter can log in using a password and id. No one can log in without knowing the
password and id. Not only that there is one more security added to it which is face
recognition. Even if a person knows another person’s password and id, he can proceed
only if the machine Recognizes the face. so this is a secure mode. Other features
include vote counting and final result. The voter can log in the candidate can register
through this system and the total number of votes each candidate got can also be
calculated.
MAR GREGORIOS COLLEGE
ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM 6
Now there is no such facility as giving passwords or IDs or face verification to the
voter. What we have now are only vote counting and the final result. The identity of
the voter is done manually now. It this new system develops, everything will be
automated, that is register the user, identify the user and whom all voted all these
details will be automated.
Main Objectives
§Used to automate the manual system. Entire manual operations are converted into the
computer by the project.
§The user just needs to give the necessary details and the entire operations are
performed by the system.
§The chances of errors are reduced in the project.
§The time required for updating different records is reduced by the project.
§The project is designed to improve the manual system used for voting. All the
operations are converted to different blocks of the project.

4.3PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
The aim is to develop an application that seeks to use various stages of security
authentication to enhance the election process for political party elections using the
reacase study, i.e. The University of Ibadan, in the end imparting an internet platform
which permits all eligible electorate to workout their franchise from any region for the
duration of the election period.
The targets are:
1. To create a secured online voting platform where authentic city of votes and voters
are ensured with the use of mechanisms such as facial recognition and one password
time
2. To enhance Voter's identity due to the fact that because biometric functions can not
be shared.
3. To ease the trouble of queuing in the course of balloting duration in elections.
4.3.1 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
Voting in India is a Constitutional right if one is a citizen over 18 years of age. The
basic idea of this system is to create an Online Voting System that will help to suppress
deception of the manual voting system and also the prior versions of online voting by
the camera for Face Recognition and using election id and password. An online voting
system helps to securely and accurately tabulate the results.
In the near future we can even implement the system on mobile phones. The new
version can be implemented by developing an android application for voting. The
password used by the user to vote is provided by the administrator. In the future, the
user can be given the privilege of changing the password. So it helps to increase the
security of the system.

to assist the users in minimizing the time and manpower required to manage the data
in an organization, this project is a modular template system with the unique distinction
of having a simple, user-friendly environment. This means users do not need any
programming knowledge. A set of templates will be defined in the software to create
an initial view, she/he can then use the simple management interface to control the
software and perform their activities.
4.5 FEASIBILITY STUDY
Over the last year, there has been strong interest in E-voting as a way to make voting
more convenient and, it is expected, to increase participation in the election process.
E-voting systems are among those being considered to replace the traditional voting
system. E-voting may become the quickest, cheapest, and most fficient way to
administer elections d c nt votes since it nly consists of si le process or
procedure and requires a few workers within the process.
The main task of this contribution was to introduce the idea of the I-Voting systems.
Security plays a major role in the development of any E-voting system. Availability,
integrity, confidentiality, non - repudiation, and authe ication are key areas In
computer security; by amalgamating these areas of security, together the form a
cohesive bond that helps guarantee vvoter trust in the E-voting system. However, many
threats exist, that may hinder the E-voting system to function correctly such as DoS
attacks, worms, viruses, and Trojan horses to name a few.
 It is imperative to correct all weaknesses of E-voting systems to ensure full
voter trust compared to that traditional voting. A desirable voting system should be
accessible to all potential voters. In some societies like in developing countries, not all
voters have access to a computer and the internet. A good number of them do not know
about computer usage and the internet. In such cases, the internet can be used as an
option to improve voter turnout.
Feasibility is the determination of whether a project is worth doing. The process of
making this determination is called a feasibility study. This type of study determines
if a project can o should be taken. Once it has been determined that a project is feasible,
the analyst can go ahead and prepare the project specification which finalizes the
project requirement. In this project, interviews and discussions are conducted with the
staff and employees to analyze the problem. The feasibility study is the high-level
capsule version of the staff and the entire system analysis and design process. The
feasibility study can be classified into the following categories
• Technical feasibility
• Operational feasibility
• Economic feasibility

ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM 8
4.5.1 OPERATIONAL FEASIBILITY
Operational Analysis is the process of comparing the actual project execution against
the Performance Measurement Baseline. The analysis provides the project team with
an understanding of the project and its progress. Performance analysis is a measure of
the success or failure of a project using various parameters. It helps in developing a
positive culture of project management that yields excellent results.
in implementing this system. Even if the users of the organization know about
computers, the mer friendliness provides them convenience and case. Termination of
any infringement, violation, or ability that could result from the development of the
system Operational feasibility also involves the determination of the security and
validation. The working of the staff is reduced and made easier by the project. Not
only that if the staff are given per training, but then it could also reduce unnecessary
incorporation of staff to perform comparative studies.
Thus, the project will be suited to overcome organizational restrictions. Thus
considering the operational feasibility the development of the proposed system is
considered operationally feasible for the development. To ensure success, desired
operational outcomes must be imparted during design and development. These include
such design-dependent parameters as reliability, maintainability, supportability,
usability, producibility, disposability, sustainability, affordability and others. These
parameters are required to be considered at the early stages of design if desired
operational behaviours are to be realised. A system design and development requires
appropriate and timely application of engineering and management efforts to meet the
previously mentioned parameters. A system may serve its intended purpose most
effectively when its technical and operating characteristics are engineered into the
design. Therefore, operational feasibility is a critical aspect of systems engineering
that needs to be an integral part of the early design phases
 4.5.2 TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY
Technical feasibility centres around the existing system and to what extent it can
support the proposed addition. It involves manual consideration to accaccommodate
technicalhancements. If the budget is a serious constraint, then the project is judged
not feasible. The development of the system in technology will have the following
advantages.
•The new system needs less storage space. • It can produce quick and up-to-date error-free reports.
• It avoids data inconsistency.
• It provides full security on confidential data.

MAR GREGORIOS COLLEGE
ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM 9
Technical Feasibility is performed to check whether the proposed system is
technically feasible or not. This feasibility assessment is focused on gaining an
understanding of the present technical resources of the organization and their
applicability to the expected needs of the proposed system.
It is an evaluation of the hardware and software and how it meets the needs of the
proposed system. This evaluation determines whether the technology needed for the
proposed system is available and how it can be integrated within the organization. The
technical evaluation must also assess whether the existing systems can be upgraded to
use the new technology and whether the organization has the expertise to use it
4.5.3 ECONOMICAL ANALYSIS
Economic analysis is the most frequently used technique for evaluating the
effectiveness of a proposed system. More commonly known as cost/benefit analysis
we determine the benefits and savings that are expected from a proposed system and
compare them with costs. We found the benefits outweigh the costs; we decide to
design and implement the new proposed system.
Economic Feasibility valuates whether the system benefits greater than the cost.
The proposed system is a cost-effective one since the benefit of the software
outweighs the cost incurred in installing it. It can be developed under optimal expenses
with the available hardware and software.
The computerized system provides easy and faster information retrieval and saves a
lot of time and manpower In Economic Feasibility cost-benefit analysis is done to
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the personal system. the proposed system is more
economical than the existing system, since it uses GUI that reduces the operating time
of the system and is interactive and user-friendly so the change of rror is and ost
needed to modifies reduced. This deals with an evaluation of development cost
weighed against the final income or benefit derived from the development of the
proposed system

5. SYSTEM ANALYSIS
The analysis is a detailed study of various operations performed by a system and data
are collected on the available files, decision points and transactions handled by the
present system. In the system analysis phase, f,first we had to analyze the system
thoroughly and understand the process and come to an outline of the new system. It is
the first step in developing and managing systems. This is the proposed system and again
we analyze the feasibility of a proposed system which is selecting the best combination
of hardware costs.
Once the project is initiated, the analyst begins to learn about the setting, the existing
system and the physical process related to the revised system. Here the analyst should
prepare an organization chart with a list of functions and the people who perform them.
This will provide a better feel for the work environment.
5.1 HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SPECIFICATIONS
 Hardware and software requirements for the installation and smooth functioning of
this Project could be configured based on the requirement needed by the component of
the Operating environment that works as a front-end system here we suggest minimum
Configuration for both hardware and software components. Working off with this
software is a requirement concrete on system environments. It includes two phases the
development of this project deals with the following environment
•Hardware Requirements
•Software Requirements
5.1.1 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
The selection of Hardware is very important in the existence and proper working of any
software. In the selection of hardware, there are many features that influence the success
of a project. Here, we are providing the online houseboat tour booking system. The main
feature of this application is that customers can choose houseboats, and check the deals,
and different packages by maintaining their exclusivity. This project offers complete
satisfactto for the customers.
•Memory: 2GB
• Processor: i5 processor
• Input device: MOUSE, KEYBOARD,WEB CAMARA
• Output device: MONITOR
5.1.1 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
One of the most difficult tasks is the selection of the software once the system
requirement is known is determining whether a particular software fits the requirements.
After initial selection, further security is needed to determine the desirability of software
with other candidates. This section first summarizes the application requirement
question and then suggests more detailed comparisons.

• Front-end: NetBeans
• Back-end: MySQL Server
• Operating System: Windows 10
The operating system is the software responsible for allocating resources, including
memory, processor, timer, disk space and peripheral devices such as printers and
monitors. All application programs are using the operating system to gain access to these
resources, as they are needed. Popular operating systems are WINDOWS, UNIX,
LINUX etc.
The operating system provides certain services to programs and users of these programs
such as program execution, input-output operation, calculation, resource allocation etc.
Convolution Neural Network Algorithms
When it comes to Machine Learning, CNS perform really well. Artificial Neural
Networks are used in various classification tasks like image, audio, words. Different
types of Neural Networks are used for different purposes, for example for predicting
the sequence of words we use Recurrent Neural Networks more precisely an LSTM,
similarly for image classification we use Convolution Neural networks. In this blog
we are going to build a basic building block for CNN.
Before diving into the Convolution Neural Network, let us first revisit some concepts
of Neural Network. In a regular Neural Network there are three types of layers:
Input Layers: It’s the layer in which we give input to our model. The number of
neurons in this layer is equal to the total number of features in our data (number of
pixels in thecase of an image).
Hidden Layer: The input from the Input layer is then feed into the hidden layer. There
can be many hidden layers depending upon our model and data size. Each hidden layer
can have different numbers of neurons which are generally greater than the number of
features. The output from each layer is computed by matrix multiplication of output of
the previous layer with learnable weights of that layer and then by the addition of
learnable biases followed by activation function which makes the network nonlinear.
Output Layer: The output from the hidden layer is then fed into a logistic function like
sigmoid or softmax which converts the output of each class into the probability score
of each class.
The data is then fed into the model and output from each layer is obtained this step is
called feedforward, we then calculate the error using an error function, some common
error functions are cross-entropy, square loss error, etc. After that, we backpropagate
into the model by calculating the derivatives.
This step is called Backpropagation which basically is used to minimize the loss.
Here’s the basic python code for a neural network with random inputs and two hidden
layers.

ALGORITHM
activation = lambda x: 1.0/(1.0 + np.exp(-x)) # sigmoid function

hidden_1 = activation(np.dot(W1, input) + b1)
hidden_2 = activation(np.dot(W2, hidden_1) + b2)
output = np.dot(W3, hidden_2) + b3
5.2 DATA FLOW DIAGRAM (DFD)
 A data flow diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of the "flow" of data through
an information system, modelling its process aspects. A DFD is often used as a
preliminary step to create an overview of the system without going into detail, which
can later be elaborated. DFDs can also be used for the visualization of data processing
(structured design).A DF D shows what kind of information will be input to and output
from the system, how the data will advance through the system, and where the data will
be stored It does not show information about the timing of prothe cess or information
about whether processes will operate in sequence or in paralle,l unlike a flowchart which
also shows this information. Data flow diagrams are also known as bubble charts, DFD
is a designing tool used in the top-down approach to System Design. This context-level
DFD is next "exploded". to produce a level 1 DFD that shows some of the detail of the
system being modelled. The level 1 DFD shows how the system is divided into
subsystems (processes), each of which deals with one or more of the data flows to or
from an external agent, and which together provide all of the functionality of the system
as a whole. It also identifies internal data stores that must be present for the system to
do its job and shows the flow of data between the various parts of the system.
Data flow diagrams are one of the three essential perspectives of the structured Systems
analysis and design method SSADM. The sponsor of a project and the end users will
need to be briefed and consulted throughout all stages of a system's evolution. With a
data flow diagram, users can visualize how the system will operate, what the system
will accomplish, and how the system will be implemented
DFD Notations
• Process:
They produce one or more data outputs. Processes are represented by round rectangles
in Data Flow Diagram. Each process has a unique name and number. This name and
number appear inside the rectangle that represents the process in Data Flow Diagram.
Process name should be unambiguous and should convey as much meaning as possible
without being too long
MAR GREGORIOS COLLEGE
ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM 13
•Data store:
A data store is a repository for data that are temporarily or permanently recorded within
the system. It is an "inventory" of data. These are the common link between data and
process models. Only processes may connect with data stores. There can be two or more
systems that have a data store. This can occur in the case of one system updating the
data store, while the other system only accesses the data. Processes can enter data into
a data store or retrieve data from the data store. Each data has a unique name.
• Data Flows:
Data flows show the passage of data in the system and are represented by the lines
joining system components. An arrow indicates the direction of flow and the line is
labelled by name of the data flow.
• External Entities:
External entities are outside the system but they either supply data into the system or
use other system outputs. They are entitiesovern which the designer has control. They
may be an organization's customer or other bodies with which the system interacts.
External entities that simply data into the systems are sometimes called sources.
External entities that are system data are sometimes called sinks. These are represented
by rectangles in the DFD.

5.4 USE CASE DIAGRAM
A UML use case diagram is the primary form of system/software requirements for a
new software program underdeveloped. Use cases specify the expbehaviourhavior
(what), and not the exact method of making it happen (how). Use cases once specified
can be das enoted both textual and visual representation (ie, use case diagram). A key
concept of use case modeling is that it helps us design a system from the end user's
perspective. It is an effective technique for communicating system behavior in the user's
terms by specifying all externally visible system behavior. A use case diagram is usually
simple. It does not show the detail of the use cases. It only summarizes some of the
relationships between use cases, actors, and systems and it does not show the order in
which steps are performed to achieve the goals of each use case.

5.5ACTIVITY DIAGRAM
An activity diagram is a flowchart to represent the flow from one activity to another
activity. The activity can be described as an operation of the system. The control flow
is drawn from one operation to another. This flow can be sequential branched, or
concurrent Activity diagrams deal with all types of flow control by using different
elements such as fork, join, etc. The basic purpose of activity diagrams is like the other
four diagrams. It captures the dynamic behaviour of the system.
Initial Node A black circle is the standard notation for an
initial state before an activity takes place. It can
either stand alone or you can use a note to
further elucidate the starting point.
Activity The activity symbols are the basic building
blocks of an activity diagram and usually have
a short description of the activity they
represent.
Control Flow Arrows represent the direction flow of the flow
chart. The arrow points in the direction of
progressing activities.
Branch A marker shaped like a diamond is the
standard symbol for a decision. There are
always at least two paths coming out of a
decision and the condition texts let you know
which options are mutually exclusive.
Fork A fork’s splits one activity flow into two
concurrent activities.
Join A join combines two concurrent activities back
into a flow where only one activity is
happening at a time.
The f The final flow marker shows the ending point
for a process in a flow.The difference between a
final flow node and the end state node is that the
latter represents the end of all flows in an
activity.
Complete Activity Flow The black circle that looks like a selected radio
button is the UML symbol
for the end state of an activity.As shown in two
examples above,notes can also be used to
explain an end state.
Notes The shape used for notes.

System Design involves translating system requirements and conceptual design
into technical specifications and the general flow of processing. It is a high level strategy
for solving the problem and building a solution. System Design includes decisions
about the organization of the system into subsystems, the allocation of subsystems
to hardware and software components and major conceptual and policy decision that
forms the framework for detailed design.
There are two levels of system design:
Logical design
• Physical design.
In logical design, the designer produces a specification of the major features of the
system which meet the objectives. The delivered products of logical design include
current requirements of the following system components:
• Input design.
• Output design.
• Database design.
Physical Design takes this logical design blueprint and produces the program software,
files and a working system. Design specifications instruct programmers about what
the system should do. The programmers in turn write the programs that accept input
from users, process data, process reports and store data in files. Data flow diagrams are
the central tool and the basis from which other components are developed. The
transformation of data from input to output, through the pro,cess may be described
logically and independently of the physical components.
6.1 INPUT DESIGN
The automation is easy and free from errors. Input design is the art of overall system
design that needs careful attention and includes specifying the means by which actions
are taken.
To produce a cost-effective method of input.
To achieve the highest possible level of accuracy.
To ensure that the input is acceptable and understood by the user.
one is the current password, and another is a secondary password, which allows us to
transition to the new password.
INPUT STAGES:
The main input stages can be listed below:
•Data recording
•Data transaction
•Data conversion
•Data verification
•Data control
•Data transmission
•Data validation
•Data correction
 INPUT TYPES:
MAR GREGORIOS COLLEGE
ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM 58
It is necessary to determine the various types of inputs. Inputs can be categorized
as follows:
External inputs, are prime inputs for the system.
Internal inputs, are user communications with the system.
Operational, which are the computer department’s communication to the system.
Interactive, which are inputs entered during a dialogue.
6.2 OUTPUT DESIGN
Output from the computer sysis are required primarily to communicate the results of
processing to the user. They are also used to provide a permanent copy of the results
for later consultations. The various types of outputs in general are:
External Outputs, whose destination is outside the organisation. Internal Outputs, whose
destination is within the organization.
User’s main interface with the computer.
Operational Outputs, whose use is pure within the computer department.
Interface Outputs involves user communicating directly.
OUTPUT DEFINITION:
The Output should be defined in terms of the following points:
Types of the output.
• Content of the output.
• Format of the output.
• Formal of the output.
• Location of the output.
• Frequency of the output.
• The volume of the output.
• The sequence of the output.
It is not always desirable to print or display data as it is held on a computer. It should
be decided as to which form of the output is the most suitable.
For example:
Will decimal points need to be inserted?
Should leading zeros suppressed.

6.2DATABASE DESIGN
A Database is a collection of interrelated data with minimum redundancy to serve many
applications. In n database Environment, common data are available and used by several
users. Instead of each user managingtheir ownn data, authorized user share data across
applicationtion with database software managing the data as an entry.
The database design phases, data are represented using a certain data model. The data
model is a collection of concepts or notations for describing data, data relationships, and
data semantics and data constraints. Most data models also include a set of basic
operations for manipulating data in the database
6.3.1 TABLE DESIGN
Database files are the key sources of information in the system. Theseiles should be
properly designed and planned for the collection, accumulation, and editing of the
required information. The objectives of the file design are to provide effective auxiliary
storage and to contribute to the overall efficiency of the computer program component
of the system. In the concepts of database design, there are two types of data-physical
data and logical data.
Physical data is that which is written on those pieces of paper. Logical data are those,
which are calculated based on some of the retrieved data in a certain sequence in
summary form. In a computer-based data processing system, the separation of physical
and logical data provides the same advantages: admin

 7. TESTING
SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT
In the development of Online voting system demand is based on windows, sql and
Sublime text softwares constructed from the specification proposed in the design
phase.
All necessary procedures manuals software specification and other documentation are
compiled. The Software is designed in user friendly manner. So that even a beginner in
computer can handle the system without much difficulty. In the development phase, all
the design specification are implemented with minimum cost and necessary care has been
take in order to hide the implementation details from uses
 System development resolves around a life cycle that begins with recognition to
user needs. Following a feasibility study, the key stages of the cycle are evaluation of the
present system, information gathering, cost/benefit analysis, detailed design and
implementation of the candidate system.
The life cycle is not a procedure that deals with hardware and software. It is building
computer based system to help the user to open at a business or make decision effectively
and manage an enterprise successfully.
The stages of system development are follows:
• Initial investigation
• Feasibility study
• Analysis
• Design
• Implementation
• Post implementation and maintenance
7.1 UNIT TESTING
Unit testing enables a programmer to detect error in coding. A unit test focuses
verification of the smallest unit of software design. The testing was carried out during the
coding itself. In the testing step, each module is to be work satisfactory at the excepted
output from the module.
Project aspect:
 The front end design consist of various forms. They were tested for data acceptance.
Similarity, the back end also tested for successful acceptance and retrieval of data.
 7.2 INTEGRATION TESTING
 System testing integration testing is a systematic technique for constructing tests to
uncover error associated with the interface. It comprises two or more developers or
development team combining the program to determine how they work together.
MAR GREGORIOS COLLEGE
ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM 69
7.3 SYSTEM TESTING
 System testing is actually a series of different testing whose primary purpose is to fully
exercise the computer based system. Software testing is critical element of software
quality assurance and represent the ultimate review of the specifications, design and
coding. System testing makes a logical assumption that all the part of the system is
correct, the goal will be successfully achieved. During testing the major activities are
concerned on the examination and modification of the source code.
 Testing is a process of executing a program with intend of finding an error. A good test
is one that uncover an as yet undiscovered error.
Testing objects are:
• Unit testing
• Integration testing
• Validation testing
• Output testing
VALIDATION TESTING
Evaluating software during the development process or at the end of the development
process to determine whether it satisfies specified business requirements. Validation
Testing ensures that the product actually meets the client's needs.
OUTPUT TESTING
This testing is not concerned about the source code of the application. Each
functionality of the software application is tested by providing appropriate test input,
expecting the output and comparing the actual output with the expected output

8. ENHANCEMENT
In nearfuture we can even implement the system in mobile phones. The new version can
be implemented by developing an android application for voting. The password used by
the user to vote is provided by the administrator. In the future the user can be given the
privilege of changing the password. So, it helps to increase the security of the system
Implementation is the project where the theoretical design is turned into a working
system and is giving confidence on the new system for the uses that it will work
efficiently and effectively .It involves careful planning, investigation of current system
and its constraints on implementation, design of methods to achieve the changeover, an
evaluation, of changeover methods. Apart from planning major task of preparing the
implementation are education and training of users. The more complex system being
implemented, the more involved will be the system analysis and the design effort
required just for implementation, on implementation coordinating committee based on
policies of individual organization has been appointed.The implementation process
begins with preparing the plan for the implementation for the system. According to this
plan, the activities are to be carried out, discussion made regarding the equipment and
resources and the additional equipment as to be acquired to implement the new system.
The implementation is the final important phase. The most critical stage in achieving
successful new system and in giving the user confidence that the new system will work
and be effective. The system can be implemented only after through testing is done and
if it found to working according to the specification. This method also offers the greatest
security. Since the old system can take over if the errors are found or inability to handle
certain type of transaction while using new system
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
Implementation includes all those activities that take place to convert from old system
to new. At this stage the theoretical design is turned into a working system. The crucial
stage in achieving a successful new system and giving confidence on the system for the
users that will work efficiently and effectively. The implementation involves careful
planning, of the current system and its constraints on implementation, design of methods
to achieve the changeover require the continuing involvement of a large proportion of
computer department resources. Most changes arise in two ways.
Maintenance is continued till the product is reengineered or deployed to another
platform. Maintenance is also done based on fixing the problem reported, changing the
interface with other software or hardware, enhancing the software. Any system
developed should be secured and protected against possible hazards. Security measures
are provided to prevent unauthorized access of the database at various levels. An
uninterrupted power supply should be provided so that power failure or voltage
fluctuations will not erase the data in the file.

9.CONCLUSION
As we see that existing voting system has many defects such as lengthy process, time
taking, not secure, bogus voting, no security level but now we can say that our approach
is more useful and secure from the existing system.
Since,we are using two level of security in this proposed system the false voters can be
easily identified. The facial authentication technique is very much useful in identifying
the fraud voters, so we can avoid the bogus votes during election commission. The
voters can cast their voting from anywhere by login to our proposed smart voting system
through internet. As every operation is performed through internet connectivity so, it is
onetime investment for government. Voters’ location is not important but their voting
is important. Smart voting system provides updated result at each and every minute.
Also requires less manpower and resources.
We proposed the process of an online system, which includes systems like enlistment
of voters, vote casting, vote checking, and pronouncing results which would establish a
decent answer to substitute for the framework that is in the institutes in Kenya. The aim
is to develop an application that seeks to use various stages of security authentication to
enhance the election process for political party elections using the real case study, i.e.
the University of Ibadan, ultimately providing an online platform which enables all
eligible voters to exercise their franchise from any location during the election period.
